-- Overview --

A program that will randomize the abilities that Kirby will gain from eating enemies in Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land (KNDL).
Ex. When eating a fire enemy, instead of gaining the fire ability, Kirby will gain a random ability.

-- Usage --

Currently, there is a .lua script intended to be used with BizHawk or similar lua-compatible emulator and a US ROM of Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land for GBA.
The lua script edits the RAM in real time, ensuring a completely random ability each time an enemy is swallowed.

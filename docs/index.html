        <h1>Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land Randomizer</h1>
        <p>I've made a randomizer for <i>Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land for Game Boy Advance</i>. This is a remake of Kirby's Adventure, the other game I've made a randomizer for. It has many of the same features, but doesn't support level randomization yet. However, it does offer more new color combinations!</p>

        <h3>Changed Abilities</h3>
        <p>Eating enemies now gives you a new ability at random! When you run the randomizer and select the <i>Randomize enemies</i> option, all of the enemy abilities are switched around. This is only done once, so the abilities that enemies give you are set for the entire game. If you want the abilities to be <i>truely</i> random, I've also included a Lua script for certain emulators that does just that!</p>

        <h3>New Color Options</h3>
        <p><i>Nightmare in Dream Land</i> is a cool game. However, the other Game Boy Advance Kirby game, <i>Kirby and the Amazing Mirror</i> had different colors you could unlock for Kirby, I wish you could do that in this game... Well, worry not! The randomizer also allows you to change Kirby's palette to any of the 13 new colors from <i>Amazing Mirror</i>, and several other colors based on other games in the series!</p>
